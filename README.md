## Introduction

Customer segmentation is a crucial task in marketing and business strategy. It involves categorizing customers into groups that share similar characteristics, enabling businesses to tailor their marketing efforts, improve customer experience, and optimize business strategies.

This project explores different unsupervised machine learning algorithms, primarily focusing on clustering techniques such as K-means. We aim to uncover hidden patterns and segments within the customer base by applying these algorithms to customer data.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess customer data to ensure it's suitable for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Gain insights into the distribution and characteristics of customer attributes.
- **Feature Selection:** Select relevant features for clustering algorithms.
- **Clustering Algorithms:** Apply K-means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN to segment customers.
- **Visualization:** Visualize customer segments and their characteristics using plots and graphs.
- **Interpretation:** Interpret the clustering results and provide actionable insights for marketing strategies.
